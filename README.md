## Diet Coke review in NYC ðŸ—½ðŸ¥¤

This is a simple, markdown-powered website for posting reviews of Diet Cokes at restaurants in NYC.

It is not componentized very well, and doesn't use TypeScript, as a project this pointless doesn't deserve static type checking.

It is largely based on this project: https://github.com/rebelchris/next-markdown-blog.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
